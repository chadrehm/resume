        <p><b>My name is Chad Rehm</b> and I have been a Software Developer for seven years.  In that time I have worked with many programming languages and software applications.  Primarily I work with Javascript using React JS, Ruby, and Java.  Typically I will work directly with customers to develop their stories, write use cases, transform the use cases to smaller tickets, and preform the work.  I can work solo, with a group, or as a lead to complete a project.</p>
